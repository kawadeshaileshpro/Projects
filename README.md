Household Loan Default Prediction Using NSSO & SECC Data
üìñ Project Overview
Loan defaults are a growing concern in India, particularly in rural and semi-urban areas where access to formal credit is limited. Traditional credit scoring often ignores socio-economic realities that strongly influence repayment behavior.

This project integrates publicly available datasets:

NSSO Household Loan Data (loan-level household records)

SECC (Socio-Economic and Caste Census) District-Level Data (assets, deprivation, education, land, caste, etc.)

We build a machine learning framework to:

Predict household-level loan default risk

Provide transparent & interpretable insights using SHAP

Enable natural language explanations via LLMs + RAG

üìÇ Data Sources
NSSO Household Loan Data (Unit-level records)

Contains detailed information on households with one or multiple loans

Loan attributes: amount, tenure, interest rate, purpose, source of credit, repayment status

SECC Datasets (District-Level)

Household asset ownership

Land ownership

Income profile & income sources

Socio-economic deprivation indicators

Caste & tribal composition

Educational profile

Household summary statistics

Optional Additional Data

PMMY / Credit Bureau aggregates (for validation of results)

District-level shapefiles / GeoJSON for loan default hotspot mapping

‚öôÔ∏è Pipeline Steps
1. Data Extraction & Loading
Downloaded SECC CSVs from government portals.

Loaded NSSO Household Loan CSV.

Ensured proper column naming & type consistency.

python
Copy
Edit
import pandas as pd
hh_df = pd.read_csv("NSSO.csv")
secc_assets = pd.read_csv("SECC_Asset_Ownership.csv")
secc_education = pd.read_csv("SECC_Educational_Profile.csv")
# ... repeat for all SECC datasets
2. Data Cleaning
Removed duplicates & invalid records.

Standardized district names across NSSO & SECC datasets.

Converted categorical codes (loan purpose, source of credit) into human-readable categories.

Handled missing values: median imputation for numerics, "Unknown" for categoricals.

3. Merging Datasets
Household-level (NSSO) joined with District-level (SECC) on "District Name".

Strategy for multiple loans per household:

Aggregated to household level using:

Max outstanding amount

Average interest rate

Most frequent loan purpose

Preserved loan-level records for robustness checks.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Loan Default Distribution (~24% default rate ‚Äì balanced enough for ML).

Financial Indicators: higher interest rates, shorter tenure, and large loan size ‚Üí more defaults.

Socio-Economic Indicators (SECC):

Higher % landless households ‚Üí more defaults

Casual labor/agriculture income ‚Üí higher defaults vs salaried

Secondary education in household ‚Üí protective against default

Geographic Hotspots: mapped district-wise default % to identify clusters in Bihar, UP, Odisha.

5. Feature Engineering
Derived household-level aggregates (loan-to-income ratio, weighted average interest rate).

Created socio-economic ratios (literacy %, land ownership %, deprivation index).

Encoded categorical features (loan purpose, caste, income source).

Scaled numeric features (StandardScaler).

6. Model Building
Train-test split (70-30).

Models tested:

Logistic Regression (baseline, interpretable)

Random Forest (non-linear patterns)

XGBoost (best accuracy & explainability)

Evaluation Metrics: AUC, Accuracy, Precision-Recall, F1-score.

7. Explainability
SHAP (SHapley Values):

Identified top drivers of loan default:

High interest rate

Landlessness

Casual labor as main income source

Low education attainment

Natural Language Explanations (LLM-powered):

Used GPT/Claude to turn SHAP insights into plain-language narratives.

Example:

"This household has a high risk of default mainly because their income comes from casual labor and they lack land ownership, making repayment less stable."

8. Geographic Hotspot Mapping
District-wise loan default % visualized on India GeoJSON maps.

Identified policy intervention zones (clusters in Eastern India).

9. RAG-based Interactive Query System (Future Work)
Developed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) prototype.

Allows credit officers to ask:

"Which districts have the highest defaults among landless households?"

"Why is repayment risk higher in agricultural households in Bihar?"

Returns natural language insights + supporting tables/graphs.
